## Resource management
Resource management involves the efficient allocation and utilization of various system resources such as CPU (Central Processing Unit), memory, I/O devices (Input/Output), and network bandwidth. The goal is to ensure that applications and processes run smoothly without interference, maximizing system performance and user satisfaction. Some of the algorithms that can be used for this functionality are:
### Segment Trees

</p>

- Segment trees are useful for handling range queries and updates efficiently. In resource management, they can dynamically allocate resources (like CPU cycles or memory blocks) based on current demands.
- For example, in a multi-tasking operating system, segment trees can manage CPU scheduling by quickly querying which processes need CPU time and updating priorities or resource allocations as needed.
- Implementing and maintaining segment trees can be complex and may require careful handling of edge cases.
- Segment trees often require more memory compared to simpler data structures due to their hierarchical nature.

### Red-Black Trees

- Red-Black Trees are self-balancing binary search trees that ensure operations (insertion, deletion, search) remain efficient even with dynamic changes in resource demands.
- They are crucial in systems that manage a large number of processes or resources, ensuring that access and modification operations (like allocating or deallocating memory) are performed optimally.
- Implementing and maintaining red-black trees can be more complex compared to simpler binary search trees.
- Requires additional memory and computational overhead to maintain the balance property.

### Bin-Packing Algorithm
- These algorithms optimize the placement of resources (such as processes or data) into predefined containers (like memory blocks or disk sectors).
- Bin-packing algorithms are used in memory management (allocating blocks of memory to processes), disk management (storing files in disk sectors), and in cloud computing (allocating virtual machines to physical hosts).
