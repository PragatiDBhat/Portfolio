## Job Scheduling
Job scheduling involves managing the execution of multiple processes or tasks efficiently on a system's resources such as CPU time, memory. Job scheduling aims to optimize resource utilization, minimize latency, and ensure fairness in executing tasks or processes on a computer system.

- Ford-Fulkerson is used to solve the maximum flow problem in network flow algorithms, particularly for determining the maximum amount of flow that can be sent from a source node to a sink node in a flow network.
- In a job scheduling context, this algorithms shows how resources (like CPU time or memory) are allocated to processes based on their requirements.
- Used in scenarios where tasks have dependencies on each other or require specific resources, influencing scheduling decisions to maximize efficiency and throughput.

- Round Robin (RR) scheduling is a preemptive scheduling algorithm where each process is assigned a fixed time slice (quantum) and executed in a cyclic manner.
- RR is commonly used in time-sharing systems where multiple users or processes share the CPU.
- Consider a system where each process gets a time quantum of 10 milliseconds. The scheduler cycles through each process, allowing it to execute for 10 ms before moving to the next process in the queue.
- RR ensures fairness by providing each process an equal opportunity to execute within a fixed time interval.
