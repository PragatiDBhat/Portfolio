## File Comparison and Version Control
File comparison and version control are essential aspects of managing changes and ensuring consistency in software development, document management, and other areas where tracking revisions and differences are crucial.

- LCS is a dynamic programming algorithm that finds the longest subsequence common to two sequences (often strings or arrays). A subsequence is a sequence derived by deleting some or none of the elements of another sequence without changing the order of the remaining elements.
- LCS is used to determine how much content two versions of a file share in common. This helps in identifying unchanged parts between versions.
- The LCS algorithm plays a significant role in these processes by enabling efficient comparison of files and versions, helping to track changes, resolve conflicts, and ensure the integrity and coherence of managed data and code bases.
