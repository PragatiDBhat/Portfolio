## Security
Operating systems provide security features such as access control, encryption, and firewall management to protect sensitive business data and systems from unauthorized access and cyber threats. Data structures and algorithms leveraged for this are:
### Aho-Corasick Algorithm 
- The Aho-Corasick algorithm is primarily used for fast multi-pattern searching. It efficiently searches for multiple patterns (keywords) in text or data streams simultaneously.
- It is crucial in real-time intrusion detection systems (IDS). IDS use pattern matching to identify known malicious patterns or signatures in network traffic or system logs.
- Aho-Corasick can quickly filter out malicious content or known malware patterns from incoming data streams.
- Requires additional memory for the automation structure, which can be substantial for large sets of patterns.
- The algorithm is efficient for static sets of patterns but may require re-building the structure if patterns frequently change.

- A Binary Search Tree is a hierarchical data structure that allows for efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations.
- These offer quick access to cryptographic keys and certificates, which are frequently used in security protocols, ensuring that authentication and encryption processes are fast and reliable.
- They can manage access permissions based on key comparisons, ensuring that only authorized entities have access to sensitive resources.
- Maintains keys in sorted order, which can be beneficial for certain cryptographic operations and access control mechanisms.
