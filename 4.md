## File management
Organizing and managing files across storage devices ensures quick access to business-critical data, supporting efficient workflows and decision-making. The following algorithms can be applied for this functionality:
### Trie Data Structure

- A Trie (or prefix tree) is a specialized tree-based data structure that is efficient for storing and retrieving strings with common prefixes. It's particularly useful for managing and organizing filenames and directories in a file system.
- Trie structures provide efficient search operations, typically in O(m) time complexity, where m is the length of the string or key being searched.
- Enables quick prefix-based searches, making it suitable for autocomplete features in file browsers or search functionalities.
- Trie structures can consume more memory compared to simpler data structures due to the overhead of maintaining nodes and pointers.
- Inserting new entries can be slightly more complex, involving the creation of multiple nodes if the entry shares common prefixes with existing entries

### B+ Trees
- A B+ Tree is a balanced tree data structure that maintains sorted data and allows efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations. It's commonly used in databases and file systems for managing large amounts of data.
-  B+ Trees serve as efficient indexes in file systems, allowing quick access to file metadata (like names, sizes, and locations).
-  Supports range queries efficiently, which is useful in file systems for operations like listing files within a directory or retrieving files based on size or creation date ranges.
-  Implementing and maintaining B+ Trees can be complex compared to simpler data structures, requiring careful handling of node splits and merges.
-  Requires additional memory for maintaining tree structure and pointers, especially in scenarios with frequent insertions and deletions.
