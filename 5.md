## Virtualization

Virtualization technologies enable businesses to consolidate servers, optimize resource utilization, and reduce hardware costs while maintaining performance and scalability.

- Segment Trees are data structures commonly used to manage and optimize the allocation of resources in virtualized environments. These environments include cloud computing platforms, virtual machine hosts, and container orchestration systems.
- Segment Trees excel at handling dynamic changes in resource demands, such as CPU cycles, memory, or network bandwidth, among virtual machines (VMs).
- They allow quick querying of resource utilization across a range of VMs and enable fast updates when reallocating resources based on workload changes.
- Implementing and maintaining Segment Trees can be complex due to the need to handle concurrency and synchronization in multi-tenant environments.

- BSTs play a crucial role in organizing and managing virtual machine resources efficiently. They are used to maintain structured access to VM metadata, such as configuration settings, resource allocations, and operational states.
- BSTs store and retrieve VM-related metadata efficiently, allowing quick access to information such as CPU allocation, memory limits, and network configurations.
- They provide efficient O(log n) time complexity for operations like searching for a specific VM or inserting new VM metadata, ensuring rapid access and updates.
