## Backup and Recovery

Operating systems facilitate automated backup processes and recovery procedures, safeguarding against data loss due to hardware failures, human error, or malicious activities.

### Skip List

</p>

- Skip Lists are versatile data structures that excel in scenarios where efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations are required, such as managing backup indices and versions in backup and recovery systems.
- Skip Lists provide average-case time complexity of O(log n) for search, insertion, and deletion operations, making them suitable for managing large sets of backup metadata efficiently.
- They maintain multiple levels of pointers that allow for skipping over elements during traversal, enhancing search performance compared to traditional linked lists.
- Ensuring the integrity of Skip Lists during updates and deletions across multiple levels can involve more complex implementation and maintenance compared to simpler data structures.

</p>

- Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union, DSU) is a data structure that manages relationships between different backup versions, facilitating efficient operations to find and merge data during the recovery process.
- Union-Find supports two primary operations:
  - Union: Connects two components (sets) into a single set, representing merging of backup data or versions.
  - Find: Determines the root representative of the set containing a particular element, aiding in identifying connected components.
- Union-Find offers nearly constant time complexity for both union and find operations, making it highly efficient for managing and merging backup data.
- The simplicity of Union-Find makes it straightforward to implement and adapt to various backup and recovery scenarios.
