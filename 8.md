## Compliance and governance
Ensuring operating systems adhere to industry regulations and standards (such as HIPAA, GDPR) helps businesses avoid legal liabilities and reputational damage related to data privacy and security breaches.

### Stable Marriage Problem 
- The Stable Marriage Problem ensures fair and compliant allocation of resources, which is crucial for regulatory adherence in various industries such as healthcare (HIPAA) and data privacy (GDPR).
- It pairs two sets of elements (e.g., individuals, resources) based on their preferences, ensuring each element is matched with the most suitable counterpart while satisfying specific constraints or preferences.
- The algorithm guarantees a stable matching where no two unmatched elements prefer each other over their current matches, promoting fairness and compliance in resource allocation.
- Ensures compliance with regulations by allocating resources in a manner that respects legal requirements and organizational policies, such as fair distribution of workloads or resources among employees or systems.

- Topological Sorting orders tasks or dependencies to ensure compliance with regulations and standards by preventing conflicts and ensuring proper sequence in operations or processes.
- It arranges tasks or nodes (representing actions or dependencies) in a linear order where each task appears before any task that depends on it.
- Ensures that tasks or processes are executed in the correct sequence to comply with regulatory requirements, such as data processing workflows under GDPR or healthcare treatment protocols under HIPAA.
- Ensures that tasks or operations are executed in a controlled and compliant manner, reducing the risk of regulatory violations or errors.

### Kruskal's Algorithm 
- Kruskal's Algorithm constructs minimal spanning trees, ensuring efficient and effective compliance with regulations by minimizing costs or resources while meeting all compliance requirements.
- Identifies the subset of edges in a connected, weighted graph that connects all vertices together with the minimum possible total edge weight.
- Ensures cost-effective resource allocation while satisfying compliance requirements, such as minimizing data storage costs under GDPR or optimizing resource utilization in healthcare settings.
- Implementing Kruskal's Algorithm requires understanding graph theory and may involve complex edge cases or scenarios that require additional computational resources.
